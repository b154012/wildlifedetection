# Remote Wildlife Detection

This is an ongoing project produced by a computer science student in UBD. The project aims at building a remote wildlife detector. Before pursuing such detection, one of the objectives is to gather and prepare an animal data. Then the model will be saved and loaded by using a number of object detection methods based on convolutional network architectures, such as TensorFlow, Darknet.
