# Remote Wildlife Detection

This is an ongoing project produced by a computer science student in UBD. The project aims at building a remote wildlife detector. Before pursuing such detection, one of the objectives is to gather and prepare an animal data. Then, the dataset will be trained, tested and evaluated before generating a customized model. The model is expected to be loaded and run on the Raspberry Pi to perform real-time object detection. A number of object detection methods based on convolutional network architectures, such as TensorFlow, Darknet, has been used and experimented throughout the project.
